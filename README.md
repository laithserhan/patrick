# Patrick's Cyberpunk Challenge

Remove all 28 squares from the board in puzzles set in a dystopian, cyberpunk world.

_Patrickâ€™s Cyberpunk Challenge_ is fun for all ages. Are you ready for the challenge?

## Instructions

The object of the game is to move Patrick around the game board and remove all 28 squares. Squares with coloured balls will remove extra squares and can make the game trickier.

You can play through 50 [classic puzzles](http://web.archive.org/web/20020127141411fw_/http://www.reldni.com:80/archive/patrick2.html#CODES) (with stars awarded for finding optimal paths), create your own puzzles (or input puzzle codes made by others), or try to get a high score in an infinite series of randomized puzzles.

### Controls

Move Patrick to available squares (highlighted in dark gray) by using the arrow keys or the mouse. Press X or click the mouse to move him there and destroy the square you were on previously.

### Puzzle codes

Puzzles are represented by the seven numbers in the top left corner. You can write down codes from interesting random puzzles you encounter, or make your own puzzles in the "Custom" mode and share the codes with your friends.

The codes are compatible with _Patrick's Challenge II_.

## Credits

This is a fanmade sequel to the 1998 freeware sensation [_Patrick's Challenge II_](http://web.archive.org/web/20020127141411fw_/http://www.reldni.com:80/archive/patrick2.html) by [Reldni Productions](http://reldni.com).

The story is loosely based on events in Reldni's more famous game, [Vinnie's Tomb](http://web.archive.org/web/20030228184112fw_/http://www.reldni.com:80/vinnie/vintomb.html), since the third part of the Vinnie's Tomb trilogy (which was never released) was going to feature Patrick in a supporting role.

The theme song is also very loosely based on the [Vinnie's Tomb theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWMtXxB0Vto).
