# Patrick's Cyberpunk Challenge

Remove all 28 squares from the board in a neverending series of calm, randomized puzzles set in a dystopian, cyberpunk world.

Patrickâ€™s Cyberpunk Challenge is fun for all ages. Are you ready for the challenge?

## Instructions

The object of the game is to move Patrick around the game board and remove all 28 squares. Squares with coloured balls will remove extra squares and can make the game trickier.

The games are randomly generated, but you can also create your own games or input game codes made by others.

### Controls

Move Patrick to available squares (highlighted in dark gray) by using the arrow keys or the mouse. Press Z (or C or N) or click the mouse to move him there and destroy the square you were on previously.

### Puzzle codes

Puzzles are represented by the seven numbers in the top left corner. You can write down codes from interesting random puzzles you encounter, or make your own puzzles in the "Custom" mode and share the codes with your friends.

The codes are compatible with _Patrick's Challenge II_. You can also go to Reldni's website to [find more codes](http://web.archive.org/web/20020127141411fw_/http://www.reldni.com:80/archive/patrick2.html#CODES) and play hand-crafted Reldni puzzles.

You currently have to use the mouse to place the objects in the correct squares manually, but I hope to have keyboard support soon so you can type in the codes. I also plan to add support for saving puzzles, so you can make your own (limited) run of puzzles to get a high score in.

## Credits

This is a fanmade sequel to the 1998 freeware sensation [_Patrick's Challenge II_](http://web.archive.org/web/20020127141411fw_/http://www.reldni.com:80/archive/patrick2.html) by [Reldni Productions](http://reldni.com), for the [Cyberpunk-themed "So bad it's good" Jam 2018](https://itch.io/jam/sbigjam2018).

The story is loosely based on events in Reldni's more famous game, [Vinnie's Tomb](http://web.archive.org/web/20030228184112fw_/http://www.reldni.com:80/vinnie/vintomb.html), since the third part of the Vinnie's Tomb trilogy (which was never released) was going to feature Patrick in a supporting role.

The theme song is also very loosely based on the [Vinnie's Tomb theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWMtXxB0Vto).
